# Elevator Simulation

In this Elevator Simulation project, as a group, we simulated the performance of various elevators currently being proposed for a new 6-story building. The simulation provided data that was analyzed and then used to make a recommendation to the lead architect.
This is a time-driven and event-driven simulation. The elevator functionality was modeled using a finite state machine (FSM), and passengers arrived at specified times with intended destinations – just like they would in a real building.
